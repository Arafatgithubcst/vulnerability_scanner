# vulnerability_scanner
This is a simple vulnerability scanner.
Creating an automated vulnerability scanner involves integrating various scanning techniques and tools to identify weaknesses in web applications, networks, or software. Below is a basic Python script using the nmap library for network scanning and requests library for web application scanning. We'll focus on simple vulnerability checks and generate a report with suggested remediation steps.

This script performs a basic network scan using nmap and a web application scan using requests and BeautifulSoup. 
It checks for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in web application login forms as an example. 
You can expand the vulnerability checks and integrate additional scanning techniques depending on your specific requirements.
Follow the steps to install it,

Step 1:
Before running this script, ensure you have the required libraries installed (nmap, requests, beautifulsoup4). 
You can install them using pip:
pip install python-nmap requests beautifulsoup4 (in kali linux please use as "Root" user)

Step 2:
For running the code use the command:
python3 vulnerability_scanner.py

You can change the port number as per your requirements from the " arguments='-sS -p 80,443' " section.
You can also change the "target_network = "192.168.1.0/24" " as per your requirements.
Again you can change the "terget_url = "https://example.com" " as per your requirements. 


The generate_report() function is a placeholder for generating detailed reports with vulnerability findings and suggested remediation steps. 
You can implement this function based on the vulnerability scan results obtained from both network and web application scans.

Note: Remember to use this script responsibly and ethically, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical considerations when scanning systems and applications for vulnerabilities.
